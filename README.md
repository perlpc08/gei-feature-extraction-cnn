# GEI Feature Extraction using ResNet50

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end pipeline for feature extraction and classification of Gait Energy Images (GEI) using a deep learning approach based on ResNet50.

## Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness of transfer learning for gait-based biometric recognition.

## Methodology
1. GEI generation from gait sequences
2. Image normalization and preprocessing
3. Transfer learning with ResNet50
4. Fine-tuning final classification layer
5. Evaluation using accuracy and F1-score

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Results
| Model      | Accuracy | Loss     | F1-score | F1-score |
|------------|----------|----------|
| ResNet50   | 97.98%   | XX       |
